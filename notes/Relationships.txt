Consider each relationship from both sides.

From the domain perspective:
	1. Does this entity own the releated entity?
	2. Does anybody else use the related entity?
	3. Is the related entity a fixed list of items? 

From the entity perspective:
		4. Is the related entity required to create	
		5. Would I ever want to do a .Include for the related entity?
		6. Would I ever want to filter a query with the releated entity?
		7. Would I every want to create both at the same time?

		Should there be a navigation property to represent the relationship?

From the handler perspective:
	Should the create handler create the related entity?

	Should the update handler create the related entity?
	Should the update handler update the related entity?
	Should the update handler delete the related entity?
